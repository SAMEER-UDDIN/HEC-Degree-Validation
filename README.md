# HEC-Degree-Validation

## Introduction
This innovative initiative employs cutting-edge semantic processing technology to revolutionize the validation of student degrees. By taking student transcripts as input, the system rigorously assesses and verifies whether a student has successfully completed their degree. This project not only showcases a commitment to leveraging advanced technologies but also addresses the critical need for efficient and accurate academic credential validation.

## Methodology
1. Input: Utilize CSV files of student transcripts as input data.

2. Processing: Extract and process course details, grades, and credit hours from the input data.

3. NLP Cosine Similarity: Apply Natural Language Processing with cosine similarity using vectorization to compare transcript data with required courses for degree completion.

4. Course Validation: Check for the presence of required courses based on cosine similarity scores.

5. Credit Hour Calculation: Calculate valid credit hours from matched courses.

6. Degree Verification: Confirm degree completion by ensuring all required courses are present and credit hour requirements are met, providing an efficient and accurate validation process.
